    "So far in the course we have only dealt with lumped parameter examples, that is where we assume that the variables are only functions of time, $f(t)$. Lumped parameter models are very useful in describing systems but they have to sacrifice accuracy. This is the case when perfect mixing is assumed or a constant temperature for a cooling jacket. Now we will look at an example where the variables are functions of time and space, $f(t,z)$. \n",

    "### Example:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here we look at the flow of a compressible liquid through a pipe that has both molar diffusion and a chemical reaction. We assume that there are no radial gradients. The cross sectional area of the pipe is given as $A$ ($m^2$). In order to write a balance for species A over the length of the pipe we have to take into account both position ($z$) and time ($t$). We will look at the section $dz$ as out system and we will conduct a balance over the system boundaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chemical reaction is assumed to be first order and is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R = kC_A $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the change is concentration of A due to the reaction is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ -kC_A A dz $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Fick's law is used to account for the molar flow due to diffusion: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ N_A = -D_A \\frac{dC_A}{dz} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$N_A = {mol_A}/{s~ m^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The inlet to the system is given by the sum of the bulk flow and diffusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v(t,z)C_A(t,z)A + AN_A $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The outlet of the system now has to be approximated by assuming a linear extrapolation from $z$ to $z + dz$. This is done with a first order Taylor series expansion. The smaller $dz$ become the better the approximation.\n",
    "\n",

    "![](taylor1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(z) \\approx f(z_r) + \\dfrac{d}{dz}f(z_r) \\big(z - z_r\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it follows that the outlet is written by:\n",
    "$$ v C_A A + AN_A + \\frac{d}{dz}\\big(v C_AA + AN_A\\big)(z + dz - z) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the accumulation term is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d}{dt}C_A A dz $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we combine all these equations we are able to describe the conservation of species A for time and position. But it can use some simplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d}{dt}C_A A dz = v C_A A + AN_A - \\big(v C_A A + AN_A + \\frac{d}{dz}(v C_AA + AN_A)dz\\big) - kC_A A dz $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtracting like terms and dividing through by $dz$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d}{dt}C_A A  = - \\frac{d}{dz}\\big(v C_AA + AN_A\\big) - kC_A A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting for $N_A$ and dividing through by A gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \\frac{d}{dz}(D_A \\frac{dC_A}{dz}) = \\frac{d}{dt}C_A + \\frac{d}{dz}(v C_A ) + kC_A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally solving for the diffusion term gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  D_A \\frac{d^2C_A}{dz^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}C_A + \\frac{d}{dz}(v C_A ) + kC_A$$\n",
